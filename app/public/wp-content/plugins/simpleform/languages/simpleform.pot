"Improve the email deliverability sent from your website by configuring "

msgstr ""

#: admin/partials/settings.php:251
msgid ""
"By default, WordPress uses the PHP mail() function to send emails, a basic "
"feature in built in PHP. However, if own website is hosted on shared server "
"it is very likely that the mail() function has been disabled by own hosting "
"provider due to the abuse risk it presents. If you are experiencing problems "
"with email reception, that may be exactly the reason why you're not "
"receiving emails. The best and recommended solution is to use a SMTP server "
"to send all outgoing emails, a dedicated machine that takes care of the "
"whole email delivery process. One important function of the SMTP server is "
"to prevent spam using authentication mechanisms that only allow authorized "
"users to deliver emails. So, using a SMTP server for outgoing email makes it "
"less likely that email sent out from your website being marked as spam and "
"lowers the risk of email getting lost somewhere. As sender, you have a "
"choice of multiple SMTP servers to forward your emails: you can choose your "
"internet service provider, your email provider, your hosting service "
"provider, you can use a specialized provider or you can even use your "
"personal SMTP server. Obviously, the best option would be the specialized "
"provider, but it is not necessary to subscribe to a paid service for having "
"a good service, especially if there are not special needs and no need to "
"send marketing or transactional emails. We suggest to use your own hosting "
"service provider’s SMTP server or your own email provider initially. If you "
"have a hosting plan, you just need to create a new email account that uses "
"your domain name if you haven't already. Then use configuration information "
"that your hosting provider gives you to connect to his own SMTP server "
"filling all the fields in this section. If you haven't a hosting plan yet "
"and your website is still running on localhost, you can use your preferred "
"email address to send email, just enter data provided by your email provider "
"(Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc...). Don’t forget to enable less secure apps on "
"your email account. Furthermore, be careful to enter only your email address "
"for that account, or an alias, into the \"From Email Address\" and the "
"\"Reply-To Email Address\" fields, since public SMTP servers have spam "
"filters particularly strong and do not allow to override the email headers. "
"Always remember to change configuration data as soon as your website is put "
"online, because your hosting provider may block outgoing SMTP connections. "
"If you want to continue using your preferred email address, ask your hosting "
"provider if the port used is open for traffic outbound."
